# This is Complin, a Part of EasyKotlinCompile
# This script was made because a user by the name of
# Mizu got frustrated that some flags do "-lorem-ipsum" 
# Instead of "--lorem-ipsum"
# or basically
# "-include-runtime" instead of "--include-runtime"
# So he made this to sure that for people who relied on -- methods can
# easily use the kotlin compiler without complainin
# But this is only for basic compiling
